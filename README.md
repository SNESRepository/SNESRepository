# SNESRepository
This is a small repository of SNES games, built for educational/research purposes as a way to digitally curate and preserve out-of-print games. The content in the repository is protected under Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976. Under this section, the law allows me to build this repository through the utilization of copyrighted content for research, personal, and educational purposes. Thus, the repository will fall under “fair use.” Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that will protect me from litigation for utilizing copyrighted work in a way that might otherwise be infringing. It is the responsibility of the user of the repository to access and view the SNES ROM images in a legal manner.
