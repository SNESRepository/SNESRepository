# SNES Repository
This is a small repository of SNES games, built for educational/research purposes as a way to digitally curate and preserve out-of-print games. The content in the repository is protected under Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976. Under this section, the law allows me to build this repository through the utilization of copyrighted content for research, personal, and educational purposes. Thus, the repository will fall under “fair use.” Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that will protect me from litigation for utilizing copyrighted work in a way that might otherwise be infringing. It is the responsibility of the user of the repository to access and view the SNES ROM images in a legal manner.

Many of the games published for previous generation video game platforms are left in licensing limbo after companies have dissolved or contracts expire, rendering them unlikely for rereleases. Even if classic games are rereleased in the future though digital distribution and emulation services like Nintendo’s Virtual Console for the Wii, there’s no guarantee that a distribution service for these games will remain maintained and updated for future generations. In the case of the Virtual Console, the service was discontinued as of January 30th, 2019. Ultimately, I hope that people who find and utilize this project are inspired to brainstorm better solutions for curating and preserving video games, and video game developers and publishers do all they can to ensure the software they create is accessible in the future.
